                      In fact, the statistics are very telling. Studies show
                      less than 1 in 7 Americans take meaningful anticipatory
                      steps toward a post-mortem succession plan prior to the
                      age of 72. Unfortunately, this inactivity leaves
                      loved-ones guessing, searching, or even worse, fighting
                      over possessions, intended wishes, monetary assets, debts,
                      etc.

                      Additionally, over two-thirds of deaths end in probate
                      court proceedings and, even worse, over $7.4 Billion of
                      unclaimed life insurance policies have yet to be claimed
                      as of 2016. So most of the time, heirs do not know if a
                      policy exists or are able to find all the necessary
                      documentation. Everyone says, “it must be filed away” or
                      “it has to be in a drawer or on top of the cabinet” or “
                      maybe it’s under the bed”...who really knows?
